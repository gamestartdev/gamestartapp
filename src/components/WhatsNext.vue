    >In 2018, GameStart donated itâ€™s equipment and technology to <a href="http://www.gamersociety.org/">a charity run by several of our experienced 
    instructors</a> with a demonstrated capacity to continue delivering our curricula to the community.  
    
    <br><br>Nate and David have since joined forces with GameChanger Charity, where they continue to 
    pursue their passion for connecting youth in need with technology that can enrich their lives. 
            <br><br><br>Nate is currently working on a memorialized version of this landing page, please check back soon for updates or get in touch with us by email: info@gamestartschool.org
